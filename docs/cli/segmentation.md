# Object segmentation

In this step, given the probabilities from pixel classification, objects will be segmented. This will result in grayscale *object masks* of the same x/y dimensions as the original images, containing unique pixel values for each object (*object IDs*, see [file types](../specs/file-types.md#masks)).

Various approaches are supported by steinbock, each of which is described in the following.

## CellProfiler

[CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org) is an open-source software for measuring and analyzing cell images. Here, CellProfiler is used for object detection and region growth-based object segmentation.

### Pipeline preparation

In a first step, a CellProfiler pipeline is prepared for processing the images:

    steinbock segment cellprofiler prepare

By default, this will create a CellProfiler pipeline `cell_segmentation.cppipe` for segmenting cells in probability images generated by the [Ilastik pixel classification workflow](classification.md#ilastik).

!!! note "CellProfiler plugins"
    The generated CellProfiler pipeline makes use of [custom plugins for multi-channel images](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/ImcPluginsCP), which are pre-installed in the *steinbock* Docker container. It can be inspected using CellProfiler as described in the following section.    

### Modifying the pipeline

To interactively inspect, modify and run the pipeline, open it in CellProfiler (see [tools](tools.md#cellprofiler)):

    steinbock tools cellprofiler

More detailed instructions on how to create CellProfiler pipelines can be found [here](https://cellprofiler-manual.s3.amazonaws.com/CellProfiler-4.1.3/help/pipelines_building.html).

!!! note "Segmentation parameters"
    Segmentation using CellProfiler is highly customizable and sensitive to parameter choices. The default parameter values may not be suitable in all cases and parameter values require careful tuning for each dataset.

    In particular, the generated pipeline is configured to down-size the probability images by a factor of two, to account for the default scaling applied in the [Ilastik pixel classification workflow](classification.md#ilastik). If a different classification workflow or scale factor has been used to generate the probability images, the down-scale factor must be adjusted accordingly.

!!! note "CellProfiler output"
    By default, the pipeline is configured to generate object masks as grayscale 16-bit unsigned integer TIFF images with the same name and x/y dimensions as the input images (see [file types](../specs/file-types.md#masks)). Custom segmentation pipelines should adhere to this convention to ensure compatibility with downstream measurement tasks.

### Batch processing

After the pipeline has been configured, it can be applied to a batch of probability images:

    steinbock segment cellprofiler run

This will create grayscale object masks of the same x/y dimensions as the original images, containing unique pixel values for each object (*object IDs*, see [file types](../specs/file-types.md#masks)). The default destination directory for these images is `masks`.
