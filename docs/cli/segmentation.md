# Object segmentation

In this step, objects such as cells will be segmented. This will result in grayscale *object masks* of the same x and y dimensions as the original images, containing unique pixel values for each object (*object IDs*, see [File types](../file-types.md#object-masks)).

Various segmentation approaches are supported, each of which is described in the following.

!!! note "Pixel classification-based segmentation vs end-to-end approaches"
    While [pixel classification](classification.md)-based image segmentation approaches use probability images to segment objects, end-to-end workflows directly operate on images without the need for a preceding pixel classification step.

## CellProfiler

[CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org) is an open-source software for measuring and analyzing cell images. Here, CellProfiler is used for object detection and region growth-based object segmentation.

!!! note "Pixel classification-based image segmentation"
    By design, the segmentation approach described in this section will be used as part of a *pixel classification-based* image segmentation workflow. As such, this approach requires probability images generated by a preceding pixel classification step as input; the assigned class probabilities will be used to identify and segment objects.

### Pipeline preparation

In a first step, a CellProfiler pipeline is prepared for processing the images:

    steinbock segment cellprofiler prepare

By default, this will create a CellProfiler pipeline `cell_segmentation.cppipe` for segmenting cells in probability images generated during the [Ilastik pixel classification step](classification.md#ilastik).

!!! note "CellProfiler plugins"
    The generated CellProfiler pipeline makes use of [custom plugins for multi-channel images](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/ImcPluginsCP), which are pre-installed in the *steinbock* Docker container. The pipeline can be inspected using CellProfiler as described below.    

### Modifying the pipeline

To interactively inspect, modify and run the pipeline, open it in CellProfiler (see [Apps](apps.md#cellprofiler)):

    steinbock apps cellprofiler

!!! note "Data/working directory"
    Within the container, your data/working directory containing the CellProfiler pipeline is accessible under `/data`.

More detailed instructions on how to create CellProfiler pipelines can be found [here](https://cellprofiler-manual.s3.amazonaws.com/CellProfiler-4.1.3/help/pipelines_building.html).

!!! note "Segmentation parameters"
    Segmentation using CellProfiler is highly customizable and sensitive to parameter choices. The default parameter values may not be suitable in all cases and parameter values require careful tuning for each dataset.

    In particular, the generated pipeline is configured to down-size the probability images by a factor of two, to account for the default scaling applied in the [Ilastik pixel classification step](classification.md#ilastik). If a different classification strategy or scale factor has been used to generate the probability images, the down-scale factor must be adjusted accordingly.

!!! note "CellProfiler output"
    By default, the pipeline is configured to generate object masks as grayscale 16-bit unsigned integer TIFF images with the same name and x and y dimensions as the input images (see [File types](../file-types.md#object-masks)). Custom segmentation pipelines should adhere to this convention to ensure compatibility with downstream measurement tasks.

### Batch processing

After the pipeline has been configured, it can be applied to a batch of probability images:

    steinbock segment cellprofiler run

This will create grayscale object masks of the same x and y dimensions as the original images, containing unique pixel values for each object (*object IDs*, see [File types](../file-types.md#object-masks)). The default destination directory for these masks is `masks`.

## DeepCell

[DeepCell](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-tf) is a deep learning library for single-cell analysis of biological images. Here, pre-trained DeepCell models are used for cell/nuclei segmentation from raw image data.

!!! note "End-to-end cell segmentation"
    This approach operates directly on image intensities and does not require a preceding pixel classification step.

To segment cells using [Mesmer](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/intro-to-deepcell/tree/master/pretrained_models#mesmer-segmentation-model) and the pre-trained `MultiplexSegmentation` dataset:

    steinbock segment deepcell --minmax

To segment nuclei using [Mesmer](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/intro-to-deepcell/tree/master/pretrained_models#mesmer-segmentation-model) and the pre-trained `MultiplexSegmentation` dataset:

    steinbock segment deepcell --minmax --type nuclear

This will create grayscale cell/nuclear masks of the same x and y dimensions as the original images, containing unique pixel values for each cell/nucleus (*object IDs*, see [File types](../file-types.md#object-masks)). The default destination directory for these masks is `masks`.

!!! note "DeepCell image data"
    Depending on the application, DeepCell requires images of specific dimensions. For example, in the case of cell segmentation using Mesmer, DeepCell expects two-channel images as input, where the first channel must be a nuclear channel (e.g. DAPI) and the second channel must be a membrane or cytoplasmic channel (e.g. E-Cadherin).

    If a `deepcell` column is present in the *steinbock* panel file, channels are sorted and grouped according to values in that column to generate the required input for DeepCell: For each image, each group of channels is aggregated by computing the mean along the channel axis (use the `--aggr` option to specify a different aggregation strategy). The resulting images consist of one channel per group; channels without a group label are ignored.
    
    If no `deepcell` column is present, images are expected to be in the correct format already.

!!! note "Pre-trained models"
    DeepCell uses pre-trained neural networks for object segmentation. To specify a pre-trained model, use the `--model` option. If not specified, the default training data for the selected application (e.g. Mesmer) is downloaded.

!!! note "Channel-wise image normalization"
    If enabled, features (i.e., channels) are [scaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) for each image and each channel independently.
    
    Specify `--minmax` to enable min-max normalization and `--zscore` to enable z-score normalization.

!!! note "GPU support"
    For compatibility reasons, DeepCell segmentation using GPUs is not supported by the *steinbock* Docker container.
    
    If GPU support is required, consider using GPU-enabled Docker containers provided by DeepCell.
